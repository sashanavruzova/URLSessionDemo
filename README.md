# URLSessionDemo
It's a demo project to showcase the usage of URLSession and MVVM.
Here a request to an API endpoint is made. The request is a list of users with names and avatars. The users are being displayed in a TableView. 
When clicking on the row a detail screen appears with detailed information.
